Welcome to the most **interactive Chess game** built using **React**!  
This project reimagines the classic two-player chess experience by combining elegant UI design, intelligent gameplay features, and essential tools like **user authentication** and **move control**. Built for fun and learning, this is not just a game — it's a showcase of **modern web development with React**.
